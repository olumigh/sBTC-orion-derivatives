# sBTC-orion-derivatives - Decentralized Derivatives Trading Smart Contract

A Clarity smart contract for implementing decentralized derivatives trading on the Stacks blockchain. This contract allows users to deposit collateral, open leveraged long/short positions, close positions to realize PnL, and manage balances in a transparent, decentralized manner.

### üîí Private Functions

| Function                   | Description                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `calculate-pnl (position)` | Compute unrealized profit or loss based on position details |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Liquidation Mechanism

Positions are liquidated automatically if the market price reaches the calculated liquidation price, which depends on:

* **Leverage used**
* **Entry price**
* **Position type (Long/Short)**

Liquidation price formula (simplified):

```clarity
Long:  entry-price * (1 - 1/leverage)
Short: entry-price * (1 + 1/leverage)
```

---

## üîß Admin Controls

The contract owner can:

* **Update current price** (acting as oracle for test purposes)
* **Transfer ownership** to another principal

---

## üì¢ Example Usage Flow

1. User deposits STX as collateral
2. User opens a leveraged long/short position
3. Position tracks entry price, size, leverage, liquidation price
4. User closes the position to realize PnL
5. Collateral and profit (if applicable) returned to the user

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Assumptions

* **Price Oracle Simplified**: The price feed is manual for testing; replace with a decentralized oracle in production
* **PnL Calculation Simplified**: Does not account for complex market factors like funding rates, slippage, etc.
* **No Automatic Liquidation Logic**: Only liquidation price calculation is provided; enforcement mechanism to be implemented externally
* **Security Considerations**: Review thoroughly before deploying to mainnet

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Prerequisites

* Stacks Blockchain setup (Testnet or Devnet recommended)
* Clarity smart contract environment
* Developer familiarity with DeFi principles

## üìÑ License

Open-source. MIT License or similar, customizable based on project preferences.
